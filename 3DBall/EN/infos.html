      <h1>Market study</h1>

      <p>
        Nowadays, we are witnessing a boom in the demand for sports in society as a whole, nearly one Frenchman in two practices sports today and 72% of them practice once a week. Indeed, jobs are less and less physical with the arrival of new technologies that allow the automation of redundant tasks in companies and even for people who already have a job in office automation which are not jobs that require much effort for the body. The employees must therefore take time for themselves to do sports and maintain themselves physically. The sport also has other virtues that allow the practitioner to feel better because the sport allows to change the ideas and to spend its energy. We will see the evolution of the sport market in our society. Then, we will study the place of soccer in the sports market. And finally, how this market has been able to adapt with the arrival of digital technology, which is an essential thing for companies today.
      </br><br>
        First of all, we can start by giving some information about this same market. Thanks to the studies we have conducted, we can deduce that the turnover represents 38.1 billion euros in France, including both household, public administration and corporate spending. We also know that the French spend an average of 253 euros per year on sporting goods. Then, we observe that the number of licensees in the French sports federations approved by the Ministry of Sports reaches 16,370,896 licensees and that the number of sports clubs in France reaches 162,187.
        France alone represents approximately 14 billion dollars of the total sales of articles in the world, which is approximately 500 billion dollars, the United States being the first supplier with its sales reaching 155 billion dollars.
      </br><br>
      Knowing that we are promoting a 3D indoor soccer tournament, we are interested in the contributions of soccer, which has the largest share of the sports market in France. 
      First of all, we can talk about the spending in this activity on this market. Indeed, we notice, since 2012, a strong growth of investments in this activity going from 2 billion euros to about 6.5 billion euros at its peak before the health crisis. 
      Secondly, we can talk about the number of licensees in this sector. Indeed, we observe a growth in the number of licensees until 2019 with at its peak about 2.2 million licensees but which has been impacted by the health crisis and has therefore inflicted a decrease in the number of licensees. Despite this decrease in the number of licensees in 2020 to 1.9 million, we observe a resurgence in the number of licensees to 2 million licensees.
      </br><br>
        We are now going to talk about the adaptation of companies to the new demands of sustainable development. Indeed, with the health crisis, companies have adopted new ways to continue their business. Among these new methods, we can note in particular the more concrete use of digital for many of them. Indeed, more and more companies are starting to make full use of digital, that is, more than 50% of them present the shift to digital as an opportunity, â…“ of them say they used digital during the health crisis and 68% would have an online presence today. For example, we can mention the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. First, we can talk about their uses in tourism to improve the user experience during visits and/or to advise sportsmen and women by analyzing their tastes and performances. 
        Then, we can talk about their uses in industry to simplify complex industrial maintenance and quality control operations. This allows to increase productivity. 
        Finally, in our situation, it is possible to use it for marketing and commerce with, for example, the preview of the product on the customer through the use of applications without the need for the user to be physically present at the store. This makes it possible to revitalize the points of sale. 
        We can mention the role of computer scientists in this sector. Indeed, IT specialists must ensure data security and the creation of the website which are some of the priority tasks for the company with digitalization to confirm a good customer experience.
        However, companies must also take into consideration the expectations of sustainable development. To meet this, companies will use different materials, develop rental and second hand markets, they will avoid surplus to supply and they will favor local products to supply themselves while highlighting the local heritage, they will also favor public transportation and implement waste sorting on site.
      </br><br>
        What we can deduce from this study is that the sports market plays an increasingly important role in our society. This influence is especially visible in the soccer market. But with the new demands regarding sustainability and the growing demand in the sports market, companies have to develop new methods and use digitalization more inclusively while developing a more sustainable plan for their company to keep up with the demands.
